# ü§ñ Assistive Robot Project

This project aims to create an **Assistive Robot** that can safely navigate its environment, assist users, and communicate between multiple microcontrollers ‚Äî specifically an **ESP32** and an **Arduino Nano BLE 33**. The robot includes environmental sensing, path tracking, and communication capabilities to support tasks such as harvesting, assistance, and environmental monitoring.

## üîå Communication Setup

The **ESP32** and **Nano BLE 33** communicate via **serial connection (UART)**:
- ESP32 TX ‚Üí Nano RX  
- ESP32 RX ‚Üí Nano TX  
- Common GND between both boards  

Baud rate: **115200 bps**  

Make sure to disconnect RX/TX when uploading new code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Code
1. Flash the `NanoBLE33COM.ino` to the **Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense**
2. Flash the `ESP32-2.ino` (or `ESP32COM.ino`) to the **ESP32**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Hardware
- Ensure all sensors and communication lines match the schematic.
- Power both boards appropriately.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Test Communication
Open Serial Monitor on both boards and verify messages are exchanged correctly.
